# HUS-Amiga-MOD-Player
Amiga MOD Player project for "Hummer Ultra Sound" sound card by TS-Labs based on Neo General Sound hardware.

   In 1997/98 the "X-Trade" company (Russia) has made a active sound card "General Sound", designed for playing Amiga
Protracker music modules (*.MOD) and samples on Russian ZX-Spectrum-compatible computers. 
   In 2008 the "NedoPC" group (Russia) was produced the advanced FPGA-based analogue of this sound card named "NeoGS", that has
Zilog Z80@24MHz CPU, 4Mb of RAM, MP3-player chip, SD-Card interface. NeoGS has 8 hardware audio channels with a sampling
rate of 37.5 kHz. 
   In marth 2015, one creatively developer, known as TS-Labs (Ukraine), was made a new hardware architecture for NeoGS,
named "Hummer Ultra Sound". The new design includes: 36 hardware 8/16bit audio channels with up to 48kHz mixing rate.
  Now we need to write a new amiga-mod player to ensure software compatibility with NeoGS.
  For this project we us–µ C programming languge and Small Device C Compiler (SDCC) v.3.4.x for Windows 7.
